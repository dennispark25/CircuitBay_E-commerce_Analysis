# Executive Summary
**Elist's** sales from 2019 to 2022 totaled **$28M** across **108k orders.** During this time, the company saw an **average order value (AOV)** of **$260 per order.**
## Sales Trends
- 2020 saw an incredible **163% surge in sales** compared to the previous year, which can most likely be attributed to increased consumer demand at the start of the COVID lockdown. During this time, Elist's top 4 products (4k Gaming Monitor, Apple products, laptops) grew in sales by **204%**, driving peak yearly sales of **$10M** and more than double 2019's order count **(34k orders)**. March 2020 in particular stood out as the month with the highest MoM-growth in sales of **50%.**
- Since then, sales have dwindled year over year to pre-pandemic levels, although 2022 sales remain **28% higher** compared to 2019. The first signs of declining sales performance were seen in 2021, with a **drop in sales and AOV of 10% and 15%**, respectively, despite a 6% growth in total orders. This decline accelerated in 2022 with a **46% decrease in sales and 40% fewer orders.**
## Loyalty Program
- The loyalty program has grown significantly since its introduction in 2019 to contribute to **more than 50% of total sales in 2022.** While the program has proven to be successful and outperforming non-loyalty sales in 2021, Q4 of 2022 showed non-loyalty members beginning to overtake loyalty members' sales performance, especially in December 2022.
- It is worth retaining the program for continued monitoring before making a long-term decision.
## Apple Refunds
- Apple products make up **58% of all refunds** from 2019 to 2022. Airpods stand out as the most ordered and most refunded product **(48k orders & 49% of all refunds)**, but it maintains a lower individual product refund rate **(5.4%)** than average when compared to other products. There is an opportunity here to discontinue the sale of low-performing products like the Bose Soundsport Headphones (0.01% of total sales) and reallocating marketing funds to Airpods.
- Additionally, there is an opportunity to drive sales for the Macbook Air and iPhone through targeted marketing campaigns and promotions as they boast some of the highest AOVs **($1,588 and $741, respectively)** but significantly lower order counts than average **(4.2k orders combined, while the average order count per product is 13.5k).**
