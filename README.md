# Executive Summary
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d32dcfbe-e1e0-4506-bf7a-3db56a64a1d9)
CircuitBay achieved **$28M** in sales revenue from 2019 to 2022, fulfilling **108k orders**. The **average order value (AOV) was $260** during this period.

## Sales Trends
- 2020 saw an incredible **163% surge in sales** compared to the previous year, which can most likely be attributed to increased consumer demand at the start of the COVID lockdown. During this time, CircuitBay's top 4 products (4k Gaming Monitor, Airpods, Macbook Air and Thinkpad laptops) grew in sales by **204%**, driving peak yearly sales of **$10M** and more than double 2019's order count **(34k orders)**. March 2020 in particular stood out as the month with the highest MoM-growth in sales of **50%**

- Since then, sales have dwindled year over year to pre-pandemic levels by 2022, although 2022 sales remain **28% higher** compared to 2019. The first signs of declining sales performance were seen in 2021, with a **drop in sales and AOV of 10% and 15%**, respectively, despite a 6% growth in total orders. This decline accelerated in 2022 with a **46% decrease in sales and 40% fewer orders**

## Loyalty Program
- The loyalty program has grown significantly since its introduction in 2019 to contribute to **more than 50% of total sales in 2022.** While the program has proven to be successful and outperforming non-loyalty sales in 2021, Q4 of 2022 showed non-loyalty members beginning to overtake loyalty members' sales performance, especially in December 2022

- It is worth retaining the program for continued monitoring before making a long-term decision

## Apple Refunds
- Apple products make up **58% of all refunds** from 2019 to 2022. Airpods stand out as the most ordered and most refunded product **(48k orders & 49% of all refunds)**, but it maintains a lower individual product refund rate **(5.4%)** than average when compared to other products

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7bd0bca-f322-4cda-8729-aa5430d97bce">
</p>

- January, September, and December consistently exhibit the highest totals in sales and order counts

- AOV shows no significant swings, but there is a slight uptick at the end of summer and carrying on until October
- Excluding March due to the massive sales upswing in 2020, July - September shows the **longest streak in MoM growth across all sales KPIs**
    - **Recommendation:** On top of marketing for holiday season, consider summer marketing campaigns and promotions to capitalize on consumer spending momentum until September

## Product Insights
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b49fd76-d7d0-44ca-aeb2-eab9ed1def54">
</p>

- **Top Product:** The 27in 4K Gaming Monitor consistently ranked as the number one product in yearly sales revenue with **$9.85M**, making up **35% of total sales**
    - Additionally, Apple Airpods and Macbook Air Laptop stand as the next top products, combining with the gaming monitor to account for **85% of all revenue**
- **Highest AOV Products:** The Macbook Air Laptop **($1,588)**, Thinkpad Laptop **($1,100)**, and Apple iPhone **($748)** lead all products in average order value
- **Most Ordered Products:** Airpods lead the way in order volume and accounts for **44.7% of all orders**

### Opportunity to Drive Sales
- The top three most ordered products (27in 4k Gaming Monitor, Apple Airpods, Samsung Charging Cable Pack) have a combined AOV of **$200**. There is an opportunity to drive sales for the three least-ordered products (Macbook Air Laptop, Thinkpad Laptop, Apple iPhone) through targeted marketing campaigns and promotions as they boast the highest AOVs **(combined AOV of $1,143)** but significantly lower order counts than average **(7.2k orders combined, while the average order count per product is 13.5k)**
    - **Recommendation:** Given the Bose Soundsport Headphones only accounts for **0.01% of total sales**, there is an opportunity to discontinue the sale of this product to reallocate marketing funds towards laptop and iPhone products
### COVID-Era Growth

</p>

- While all top 4 products more than doubled in sales in 2020, Macbook Air and Thinkpad Laptops stood out with an exceptionally higher rate of growth **(+303%)**, which can most likely be attributed to a surge in work-from-home requirements worldwide
## Regional Trends

## Loyalty Program Overview
<p align="center"><image src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6cfcbb2-42a1-4c4a-8e17-7e64a8f79063" height=450></p>

When reviewing performance across the entirety of 2019 - 2022, non-loyalty orders win out across all sales KPIs
  - **Sales: $17.1M (non-loyalty)** vs. $10.9M (loyalty)
  - **AOV: $275 (non-loyalty)** vs $240 (loyalty)
  - **Total Orders: 62.4k (non-loyalty)** vs 45.7k (loyalty)

Sales trends in the past two years, however, show that loyalty-member performance has outpaced that of the non-loyalty group. Since 2021, loyalty members have had higher revenue, AOV, and order counts with loyalty members contributing to more than **50%** of sales volume.
- While loyalty sales have been promising, September '22 marked the first time loyalty sales were eclipsed by non-loyalty sales since April '21, a **17-month run** of superior sales
- The revenue gap between the two groups has continued to increase month over month until the end of 2022 with the majority of holiday sales coming from non-loyalty members

**Recommendation:** Although the loyalty program has shown potential for further growth heading into 2023, it is recommended to continue monitoring sales performance between loyalty and non-loyalty members.

# Recommendations
Based on the findings above, recommendations are as follows:

**Marketing Effectiveness**
- A deep dive analysis on marketing channels show that **direct & email marketing campaigns** have proven to be the most effective at generating sales, making up **94.8%** of all customer accounts created. Any marketing efforts should prioritize these channels.

**Seasonal Marketing Campaigns & Promotions**
- **Summer Sale (Extended Campaign):** Capitalize on consumer buying habits with a season-long series of promotional deals & discounts to maximize revenue and order counts.
- **Fall Promotions:** Pair marketing campaigns with partial discounts targeting the North American and EMEA regions to bolster sales in October before offering the intended full holiday discounts.  

**Product Catalog Update & Focused Marketing**
- Considering the Bose Soundsport Headphones' significantly low performance, it is advised to either replace this product with another brand's headphone/entertainment product (Apple, Samsung) or remove it from the product catalog, with any financial resources attributed to Bose headphones to other products with higher sales growth potential.
    - Given their high average order values (AOVs) but below-average order volumes, prioritize marketing spend on laptop products in your top 10 markets, as well as in other high-AOV regions like South Korea. Position the iPhone as a secondary focus. 
  
**Loyalty Program**
- The loyalty program has proven to be successful in recent years, but the recent drop in performance in the last quarter of 2022 warrants continued monitoring of loyalty sales heading into 2023 and beyond. If performance continues to drop and reverts back to revenue levels in 2019/2020, consider removing the program.
- Additionally, work with the sales and marketing teams to dig deeper into loyalty member consumer behavior at a more granular level to gain a better understanding of the decrease in performance.

**Refunds**
- Collaborate with the product team to better understand the above average refund rates for the Macbook Air and Thinkpad laptops.
- It is worth investigating the high refund rate of iPhones as well once there is more sales data **(currently only 288 orders).**
